Project Title			:	Design of a single phase DC to AC inverter based on the development board

Position			:	Electronic Engineer and Programmer (Hardware)

Jobdesc	:	Design and manufacturing electronic system. Ensure that the electronic system work properly and troubleshooting when needed. Ensure that inverter produce good wave (sine wave would be better) with using oscilloscope to check. Install and observe the responds.

Project Type	:	Course Project.

Microcontroller	:	Arduino Nano

Software (Electronics)	:	Eagle and Proteus

Software (Programming)	:	Arduino IDE and Proteus (Simulator)

Component	:	Arduino, IRF630, Potentiometer

Description			 :	The inverter is a power electronic circuit used to convert direct voltage (DC) to an alternating voltage (AC). MOSFET can be used or used to make an inverter, this MOSFET in the inverter circuit functions as a switching to convert a DC voltage into a sine wave or AC voltage wave. The MOSFET used is a type N channel IRF630 with a 12V DC input voltage from power supply that can produce 220VAC / 50Hz with the help of the Arduino Development Board as a switching pattern and time regulator. After being connected to the AC load, the lamp can turn on continuously and stably.

Performance	:	The inverter can switch the DC 12V voltage in to AC 220V and drive the load (Lamp) continuously and stably.

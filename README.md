# Design-of-a-single-phase-DC-to-AC-inverter-based-on-the-development-board
The inverter is a power electronic circuit used to convert direct voltage (DC) to an alternating voltage (AC). MOSFET can be used or used to make an inverter, this MOSFET in the inverter circuit functions as a switching to convert a DC voltage into a sine wave or AC voltage wave. The MOSFET used is a type N channel IRF630 with a 12V DC input voltage from power supply that can produce 220VAC / 50Hz with the help of the Arduino Development Board as a switching pattern and time regulator. After being connected to the AC load, the lamp can turn on continuously and stably
